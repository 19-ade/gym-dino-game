This is the test gym enviroment used for implementing the RL_dino. This project is based on this [github project](https://github.com/elvisyjlin/t-rex-runner).

The game is made in javascript and embedded in the no_internet_connections webpage. To access the game one needs to extract the game from the webpage and this [github project](https://github.com/elvisyjlin/t-rex-runner) achieves just that.
